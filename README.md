=====================================
What is Burencoin?
----------------

Burencoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Burencoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/burencapital/burencoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Burencoin.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
